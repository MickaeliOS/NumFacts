## NumFacts

Hey there! 

Welcome to NumFacts, my fun side project. 
Here's the deal: you give it a number, and it gives you a cool fact about it. 
Sounds fun, right? This project was my playground for getting to know the Combine framework. 
It's all set up with the MVVM pattern.

For the network part, I'm using URLSession with MockURLProtocol for the test part.

## Got ideas?

Think NumFacts could be even cooler? I'm all ears! 
Whether you want to tweak the code yourself (go ahead, make a PR!) or just want to share your thoughts, shoot me an email at mickael.horn.pro@gmail.com. Every bit of feedback is golden.

Thanks for dropping by! Let's make learning fun. ðŸ˜‰
